# CopyOfTwitchTwitter
A Copy of a 3 person Project from a WebDev Course. The project was to build a Twitter Clone with Livestreaming and Viewing Functionality. This included Back-End API, Database Management, and Front-end using React.

Weeks 1-2: API architecture, Database schemas, and wireframes. 

Weeks 3-5: Backend API + MongoDb Database + Initial Testing (See server folder within package)

Weeks 6-8: React Frontend + integration testing (see src folder within package)

Weeks 9-10: Frontend touchups + extra features (user blocks, message hides, follow suggestion, etc.)
